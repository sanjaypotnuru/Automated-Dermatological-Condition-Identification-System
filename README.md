**Automated-Dermatological-Condition-Identification-System**:

My project is on medical field which is centered on "Automated-Dermatological-Condition-Identification-System".The main aim of our project is provide quick and accurate analytical insights about the effected skin disease to the user,my system not only classifies the skin disease and provide insights, it also provide a dedicated recommendation system on food diet and medical precautions.


My Final Year Project is categorized into 4 modules::

-->4 modules:
	~module 1:
		This module is all about initial screening i.e., to identify the presence or absence of any skin disease upon
 		uploading the image,if +ve,it should output a list of possible potential skin disease( some names which may be the skin diseases).
	  -->Aim: the user should get to know whether it is a skin diesease or not, if yes should list out some possible diseases 	
	     **input :- uploading of image.
	     **output:- Yes or No, if Yes should list out possible skin diseases.

	~module 2:
		should exactly get to know about the diseased skin disease upon uploading the image .i.e, classification and categorization the specific  		disease should happen here(train atleast 18 to 25 different types of skin diseases).if possible provide some knowledge about the skin 
		disease to the user
	-->Aim: classify and categorize the skin disease.
	   **input:-  uploading of image of effected skin disease
	   **output:- exact name of the effected skin disease,to get to know about the disease to the user upon clicking, there should be a pop up 
		      about the disease

	~module 3:
		Get's to know more about the user by diabetic prediction i.e., here the user gets to know whether he is diabetic or not.
	-->Aim: gets to know more about the user for better recommendations and for enhanced treatment 
	   **input:- enter the details manually for analying whether the user is diabetic or non-diabetic
	   **output:- Yes(diabetic) or No(Non-diabetic)

	~module 4:
		Summerize analytics report along with recomendations on food diet and medical precautions by the skin disease and diabetic/Non-diabetic.

    final result with should generate the complete summerization report(disease name,description about disease,diabetic/Non-diabetic,recommendation on food        	and medical precautions) for user's better understanding.
